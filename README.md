# Attrition-EDA
Basic Exploratory Data Analysis to find the top 5 factors affecting the company's attrition.

The given data is related to an attrition problem of a company.
Each row in the dataset represent an employee. Every employee corresponds to a value of the variable "Attrition". A value of attirion = 1 indicates that the employee has left the company. In the same way, attirion = 0 would indicate that the employee is still working in the company.

All the analysis has been done by a team of three members including me, Anirudh Sharma and Anirudha Nayak.
